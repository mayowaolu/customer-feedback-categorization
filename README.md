# Customer Feedback Categorization System

This project is a customer feedback categorization system that classifies customer feedback into multiple predefined categories (e.g., product quality, delivery issues, etc.) using a fine-tuned transformer model.

## Technologies Used
- **Hugging Face Transformers**: For the pre-trained transformer models and fine-tuning.
- **FastAPI**: For serving the model via a REST API.
- **Gradio**: For building an interactive UI.
- **MLflow**: For model versioning and tracking.
- **Weights & Biases (W&B)**: For experiment tracking.

## Steps to Run the Project

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
